#variables and simple data types

message = "hello world 2!"
print(message)

# I've created a variable named message, which is connected to a value 

message = "another hello world for the books!"
print(message)

#I can change the value of a variable in my program at any time and python will always keep track of its current value. 

#Note: variables names can only contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number. 
#Note Cont.: for example "message_1" works but not "1_message"

#Spaces are not allowed as it will cause future errors
#Avoid using python keywords and functions as variable names, as example don't use print as a variable.abs
#Python has particular reserved names for a programmatic purpose.
