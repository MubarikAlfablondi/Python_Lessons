workers = ['bob', 'harlod', 'synthia', 'mike']
for work in workers:

# so for every one in work in the list of workers, print out the list of names from work

workers = ['bob', 'harlod', 'synthia', 'mike']
for work in workers:
    print(f"that was great {work.title()}. keep it up")
# this was an example of an f-string being a great way towards showing the for loop can be used within the list and f-string.abs

#Note: Remember that indentation is important to keep a variable into its contained lists. Especially with two print functions. There can be a case of logicall error if not checking correctly
